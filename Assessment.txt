Scope
Help our master barbecue chef to optimize order in which barbecue items are grilled. Since the
space on the grill is limited and different grill items have different sizes, you need to calculate
the optimal schedule for grilling. The aim is to optimize the time for barbecuing the entire
menu. The grill measures 20cm x 30cm. The cooking time is the same for all barbecue items.
A REST API provides you with different grill menus. The service returns a list of different pieces
of meat with the required space. Your solution calculates the order in which the food is placed
on the grill and at the same time optimizes the duration of the entire meal. The console
displays how many rounds are needed to grill the entire menu.
Our REST API service provides you with different menus so that you can test your software with
different configurations. The solution should be implemented generically and output the
rounds for each grill menu.
