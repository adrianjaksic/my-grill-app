Help our master barbecue chef to optimize order in which barbecue items are grilled. Since the space on the grill is limited and different grill items have different sizes, you need to calculate the optimal schedule for grilling. The aim is to optimize the time for barbecuing the entire menu. The grill measures 20cm x 30cm. The cooking time is the same for all barbecue items.
